# InteractionSummaryBoard Modernization Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for modernizing the InteractionSummaryBoard component with a new design system that includes program-specific styling, improved UI elements, and responsive layout adjustments.

## Files to Update

1. **interactionSummaryBoard.css**
   - Replace with the new CSS file (`interactionSummaryBoard.css.new`)
   - This introduces the program color system and modernizes all UI elements

2. **interactionSummaryBoard.js**
   - Update to include new programClass getter (`interactionSummaryBoard.js.new`)
   - Adds dynamic theming based on active program tab

3. **interactionSummaryBoard.html**
   - Replace with the modernized template (`interactionSummaryBoard.html.modernized`)
   - Features program headers and improved structure

## Implementation Steps

### 1. CSS Implementation
```bash
cp force-app/main/default/lwc/interactionSummaryBoard/interactionSummaryBoard.css.new force-app/main/default/lwc/interactionSummaryBoard/interactionSummaryBoard.css
```

Key CSS changes:
- Introduction of program-specific CSS variables:
  - `--program-color`
  - `--program-color-light`
  - `--program-color-medium`
- Program-specific host classes:
  - `.pine-program` - Blue theme for 1440 Pine
  - `.nest-program` - Green theme for Nest 56
- Improved table and thread section styling
- Modern program headers with icons
- Enhanced accessibility and readability

### 2. JavaScript Implementation
```bash
cp force-app/main/default/lwc/interactionSummaryBoard/interactionSummaryBoard.js.new force-app/main/default/lwc/interactionSummaryBoard/interactionSummaryBoard.js
```

Key JS changes:
- Added `programClass` getter that returns the appropriate CSS class based on the active tab:
  ```javascript
  get programClass() {
    return this.activeTab === 'nest' ? 'nest-program' : 'pine-program';
  }
  ```
- Enhanced `renderedCallback()` to apply the program class to the host element
- Improves the component styling without requiring template changes

### 3. HTML Implementation
```bash
cp force-app/main/default/lwc/interactionSummaryBoard/interactionSummaryBoard.html.modernized force-app/main/default/lwc/interactionSummaryBoard/interactionSummaryBoard.html
```

Key HTML changes:
- Added program headers with program-specific icons
- Removed commented code and cleaned up structure
- Enhanced table structure for better accessibility
- Simplified icon implementation

## Testing

After implementing these changes, verify the following:
1. Component loads correctly with no errors
2. Program colors change when switching between 1440 Pine and Nest 56 tabs
3. Table styling is properly applied
4. Note sections use program-specific styling
5. Responsive behavior works on different screen sizes

## Design System Integration

These changes align with the newly established design standards:

1. **Program-Based Color System**
   - Each program has its own color palette
   - Colors are applied consistently across all UI elements

2. **Modern UI Elements**
   - Cards with subtle shadows
   - Program headers with icons
   - Consistent spacing and typography

3. **Improved User Experience**
   - Better visual hierarchy
   - More intuitive grouping of information
   - Improved mobile experience

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the original files can be restored from:
- `interactionSummaryBoard.css.original` (or from source control)
- `interactionSummaryBoard.js.original` (or from source control)
- `interactionSummaryBoard.html` (or from source control)

## Future Enhancements

For future development, consider:
1. Adding more program-specific themes as needed
2. Enhancing accessibility features
3. Implementing dark mode support
4. Adding animation for tab transitions

By following these implementation steps, the InteractionSummaryBoard component will have a modernized, program-specific design system that enhances user experience and visual appeal.
